          <p class="character-description">
            Homer Jay Simpson is the clumsy father of the Simpson family. With
            his wife, Marge, he has three children: Bart, a son he doesn't like,
            and Lisa and Maggie, two girls. To support his family, he works at
            the Springfield Nuclear Power Plant. Homer embodies several comical
            stereotypes of working-class Americans: he is rude, overweight,
            incompetent, rude, lazy, ignorant and loves to eat donuts; however,
            he is very dedicated to his family.
